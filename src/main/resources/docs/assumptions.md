## Assumptions

####  During the development of this assignment I have made following assumptions to proceed with my task:

* All the data in the CSV file is stored in AcademyAwards Collection.
* All the movies related data like title, user rating and Box office revenue is stored in Movies Collection.
* All the details of registered users like username and password is stored in Users Collection.
* There is only one registered user for now with username "admin" and credential "admin123". These values need to be passed as request body in Token API to get JWT.
* MongoDB test data scripts are kept under '/resources/dbscripts'
* JWT is valid for 30 minutes and this is configurable.
