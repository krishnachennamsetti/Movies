# Assumptions

During the development of this assignment I have made following assumptions and proceeded with my task:

1) All the data in the CSV file is stored in Database in AcademyAwards Collection.
2) All the movies related data like title, user rating and Box office revenue is stored in Movies Collection.
3) All the details of registered users like username and password is stored in Users Collection.
4) There is only one registered user now with username "admin" and credential "admin123". These values need to be passed in Token API to get JWT.
5) JWT is valid for 30 minutes and this is configurable.
